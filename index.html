            <p>On behalf of NGO, we appeal to you to donate generously during these <br> crisis days to mitigate the sufferings of everyone in Bangladesh and save lives.</p>

                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>The combination of heavy rainfall, warming temperatures, melting snow and frozen ground are a recipe for flash flooding.  Floodwaters are dangerous and could contain pathogens including E.coli, Salmonella, Hepatitis A and norovirus.  It is important to take proper precautions before and after a flood to ensure the safety of your food.</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>After moving to a camp where other families were also escaping the flooding, We received tools and essential aid items to help her on the road to recovery. Just nine days after collecting her shelter kit, she built a new home for her family. NGO used some leftover nail hooks to hang up the items from her new kitchen set, helping to make her shelter a home.</p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>Children should be taught to avoid water when unsupervised. After a storm occurs, puddles are natural temptations, but creeks, ditches, basically any area overflowing with water can be dangerous. Water does not always indicate its depth, and what looks like a shallow puddle may be a hole, several feet deep.</p>
